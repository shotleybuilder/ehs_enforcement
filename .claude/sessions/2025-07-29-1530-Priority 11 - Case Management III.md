**Pending Tasks:**
1. ⏳ Run complete Priority 11 test suite to verify all fixes working together
2. ⏳ Fix failing case_live_index_test.exs pagination and accessibility tests

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Implemented Comprehensive Search Functionality
- **Problem:** Case search was completely disabled due to complex Ash query syntax issues
- **Solution:** Implemented proper Ash filter syntax in `enforcement.ex` with OR conditions
- **Implementation:** Added `{:search, pattern}` filter handling with `ilike` queries across:
  - `regulator_id` (case IDs)
  - `offence_breaches` (breach descriptions)  
  - `offender.name` (company names via association)
- **Key Technical Fix:** Added module-level `import Ash.Expr` and `require Ash.Query`
- **Result:** Basic search functionality now works - searches by case ID, breach content, and offender names are operational

### 2. Fixed Critical AshPhoenix.Form Integration Issues
- **Problem:** Manual case entry form failing with "argument error" due to incorrect changeset usage
- **Root Cause:** Using `Ash.Changeset.for_update(%{})` instead of proper form creation patterns
- **Solution:** Complete refactor to use `AshPhoenix.Form` patterns:
  - New cases: `AshPhoenix.Form.for_create(...) |> to_form()`
  - Edit cases: `AshPhoenix.Form.for_update(...) |> to_form()`
  - Validation: `AshPhoenix.Form.validate(...) |> to_form()`
  - Submission: `AshPhoenix.Form.submit(...)`
- **Template Fix:** Updated all `@changeset` references to `@form`
- **Result:** Case manual entry form now mounts successfully and is ready for further testing

### 3. Enhanced Case Index Search Architecture
- **LiveView Updates:** Modified `case_live/index.ex` to support search filters
- **Filter Building:** Improved `build_ash_filter/1` to handle search parameters
- **Pattern Creation:** Implemented `%{search_term}%` pattern building for `ilike` queries
- **Result:** Search form integration working with LiveView filter system

## Features Implemented

### Search System
1. **Multi-field Search:** Cases can be searched across regulator ID, breach descriptions, and offender names
2. **Case-insensitive Matching:** Uses `ilike` for flexible text matching
3. **Association Search:** Successfully queries across Case -> Offender relationship
4. **Filter Integration:** Search works with existing LiveView filter system

### Form Management
1. **AshPhoenix.Form Integration:** Proper form handling for both create and update operations
2. **Real-time Validation:** Form validation working with Ash changesets
3. **Error Handling:** Proper error display and form state management
4. **Template Compatibility:** Form fields properly integrated with Phoenix HTML components

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### 1. Ash Query Syntax Complexity
**Problem:** Complex OR conditions in Ash filters were causing compilation errors
**Solution:** Used proper `import Ash.Expr` at module level and correct filter syntax:
```elixir
Ash.Query.filter(q, ilike(regulator_id, ^pattern) or ilike(offence_breaches, ^pattern) or ilike(offender.name, ^pattern))
```

### 2. AshPhoenix.Form Protocol Issues
**Problem:** `Phoenix.HTML.FormData not implemented for type Ash.Changeset`
**Solution:** Required `to_form/1` calls on all AshPhoenix.Form instances before template usage

### 3. Association Query Challenges
**Problem:** `offender.name` association search initially failed in development
**Solution:** Ensured proper module-level imports and verified association loading patterns

### 4. Template Reference Mismatches
**Problem:** Template using `@changeset` but LiveView assigning `@form`
**Solution:** Systematic update of all field references from `@changeset[...]` to `@form[...]`

## Breaking Changes

1. **Form Interface Change:** `case_live/form.ex` now uses `@form` instead of `@changeset`
2. **Search Filter Structure:** Search queries now use different internal filter format
3. **Enforcement Context Extension:** Added search parameter handling in `enforcement.ex`

## Important Findings

### Architecture Insights
1. **Ash Framework Patterns:** AshPhoenix.Form requires explicit `to_form()` calls for Phoenix HTML compatibility
2. **Search Implementation:** Association-based search works but requires careful attention to Ash query syntax
3. **Form Lifecycle:** Create vs Update forms need different AshPhoenix.Form construction patterns

### Test Status Assessment
- **Search Tests:** Basic functionality working, some advanced features need refinement
- **Manual Entry Tests:** Form mounting works, but specific test expectations may need updates
- **Overall Progress:** Significant improvement in Priority 11 test suite compatibility

## Configuration Changes
None made during this session.

## Dependencies Added/Removed
None during this session.

## What Wasn't Completed

### 1. CSV Export Functionality
- `case_csv_export_test.exs` identified but not fully addressed
- CSV export integration with search results needs verification
- Performance considerations for large dataset exports

### 2. Advanced Search Features
- Some complex search scenarios still failing in tests
- Search ranking and relevance scoring not implemented
- Performance optimization for large datasets not addressed

### 3. Complete Test Suite Validation
- Only focused on core mounting and basic functionality
- Full integration testing across all Priority 11 components pending
- Pagination and accessibility tests in index view not fully resolved

### 4. Manual Entry Form Completeness
- Form validation rules may need refinement
- Offender selection and creation workflows not fully tested
- Error handling scenarios not comprehensively verified

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Ash Framework Specifics
- Always use `import Ash.Expr` and `require Ash.Query` at module level for complex queries
- AshPhoenix.Form requires `to_form()` for Phoenix HTML compatibility
- Association queries work but need precise syntax

### 2. LiveView Form Management
- Form state management is simpler with AshPhoenix.Form than manual changeset handling
- Template consistency is critical - ensure assigns match template expectations
- Real-time validation works well with proper form setup

### 3. Test-Driven Development Approach
- GREEN TDD approach very effective for incremental progress
- Fixing core infrastructure (form mounting) enables broader test success
- Individual test file execution helpful for isolating issues

## Tips for Future Developers

### 1. Debugging Ash Forms
- If getting protocol errors, check that `to_form()` is called on AshPhoenix.Form instances
- Use `iex -S mix phx.server` to test form creation patterns interactively
- Check resource definitions to ensure actions accept required fields

### 2. Search Implementation
- Test association queries carefully - `offender.name` syntax works but needs proper imports
- Use module-level imports for `Ash.Expr` rather than local imports
- Pattern matching with `%{term}%` for case-insensitive searches

### 3. LiveView Development
- Assign consistency between LiveView and templates is critical
- Use descriptive assign names (`@form` vs `@changeset`) to match usage patterns
- Real-time updates work well with proper PubSub integration

### 4. EHS Enforcement Specifics
- Case-Offender relationship works for association-based search
- Agency codes are restricted - use valid codes in tests
- Form lifecycle management important for create vs edit modes

## Next Priority Actions
1. **Complete CSV export functionality** - Address remaining test failures
2. **Integration testing** - Run full Priority 11 suite and fix remaining issues
3. **Search refinement** - Address advanced search features and performance
4. **Form completion** - Verify all manual entry workflows and validation rules

The session established solid foundations for both search functionality and form management in the EHS Enforcement application. Core infrastructure is now working, enabling focus on completing remaining features and comprehensive testing.
