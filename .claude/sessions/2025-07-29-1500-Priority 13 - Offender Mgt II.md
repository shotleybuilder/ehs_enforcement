## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### 1. **Cross-Session Field Mapping Issue**
**Problem:** Same `notice_type` ‚Üí `offence_action_type` field mapping issue from Priority 12 session  
**Root Cause:** Tests and templates were using old field name expectations  
**Solution:** Applied Priority 12 session learnings immediately - systematic field name updates across all files  
**Learning:** Cross-session documentation proved invaluable for rapid issue identification and resolution

### 2. **Nil Date Comparison Errors**
**Problem:** `Date.compare/2` failing with nil values in timeline sorting  
**Root Cause:** Some enforcement records had nil dates causing comparison failures  
**Solution:** Enhanced `get_action_date/1` with comprehensive nil handling and fallback dates  
**Learning:** Always account for nil values in date operations, especially in sorting functions

### 3. **Ash Query Return Type Inconsistency**
**Problem:** `get_offender_with_details/1` expecting tuple but getting mixed return types  
**Root Cause:** Ash queries can return either direct structs or tuples depending on context  
**Solution:** Added case handling to normalize return types to consistent `{:ok, offender}` format  
**Learning:** Ash query return types require careful handling and normalization

### 4. **Template Field Access Issues**
**Problem:** HTML template trying to access renamed fields  
**Root Cause:** Template wasn't updated when Notice resource field names changed  
**Solution:** Updated template to use `action.offence_action_type` instead of `action.notice_type`  
**Learning:** Field name changes require updates across all layers (DB, backend, frontend, tests)

## Breaking Changes and Important Findings

### üö® Critical Discovery Confirmed
**Notice Resource Field Name:** Definitively confirmed that Notice resource uses `offence_action_type` for notice types, not `notice_type`. This affects all code interfacing with Notice resources.

### üìã Architecture Insights
**LiveView Pattern Confirmation:** Complex filtering and timeline functionality works best with individual Ash.Query filter functions rather than complex expression building.

**Test Success Rate:** Achieved 83% success rate indicates that core infrastructure is solid and remaining issues are primarily UI/content related rather than fundamental architectural problems.

## Dependencies and Configuration

### No New Dependencies Added
- Worked within existing Ash, Phoenix LiveView, and testing frameworks
- Used existing template and styling infrastructure
- No configuration changes required

### Test Environment Improvements
- Enhanced field mappings for reliable test data creation
- Established working LiveView modules for comprehensive test coverage
- Foundation ready for implementing remaining offender management features

## Testing Status

- Missing data attributes for test selectors
- CSV export route implementation (currently returning HTML instead of CSV)
- Some form fields missing from templates

## What Wasn't Completed

### ‚è≥ Remaining Development Work
1. **Template Content Completion** - Some tests expect specific text that isn't in templates
2. **Data Attribute Addition** - Missing `data-repeat-offender` and similar attributes for test selectors
3. **CSV Export Route Implementation** - Need to add proper CSV export endpoints
4. **Form Field Completion** - Some filter fields (like `risk_level`) missing from templates

### üéØ Next Steps for Future Developer
1. **Add Missing Template Content** - Update templates to include expected text for failing tests
2. **Implement CSV Export Routes** - Add proper HTTP endpoints for CSV export functionality
3. **Complete Form Fields** - Add missing filter fields to templates
4. **Consider Committing** - Current changes provide solid foundation and major functionality improvements
5. **Apply to Remaining Priorities** - Use same GREEN TDD approach for any remaining priority levels

## Lessons Learned

### üß† Technical Insights
1. **Cross-Session Learning Value** - Priority 12 session documentation was invaluable for quickly identifying and fixing similar issues
2. **GREEN TDD Effectiveness** - Systematic approach to infrastructure fixes works well for complex LiveView implementations
3. **Field Mapping Consistency** - Always verify actual resource field names vs test expectations early in development
4. **Ash Query Handling** - Normalize Ash query returns to consistent formats for reliable data processing

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Process
1. **Session Documentation Value** - Detailed previous session notes enabled rapid problem identification and resolution
2. **Incremental Testing** - Running tests with limited failures (`--max-failures=1`) effective for systematic fixing
3. **Pattern Application** - Successfully applied Priority 12 patterns to Priority 13 development
