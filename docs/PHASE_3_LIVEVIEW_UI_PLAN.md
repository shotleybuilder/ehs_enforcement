# Phase 3: LiveView UI Implementation Plan

**Status**: In Progress - Phase 3.1 & 3.2 & 3.3 & 3.4 & 3.5 & 3.6 & 3.7 Complete ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-25
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive Phoenix LiveView interface for the EHS Enforcement application using the Ash framework as the core data layer. This phase includes Ash resource design, database setup through Ash migrations, data migration from Airtable, and interactive user interfaces powered by Ash queries and actions. PostgreSQL becomes the primary data store via AshPostgres, with Airtable being used only for one-time historical data import, after which it can be retired.

## Phase 3 Components

### 3.1 Ash Framework Setup and Resource Design ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: All Ash resources implemented and tested (23 tests passing)

#### Architecture Implemented

**Domain Structure**: Two-domain architecture separating core enforcement logic from sync operations:
- `EhsEnforcement.Enforcement` - Core domain with Agency, Offender, Case, Notice, Breach resources
- `EhsEnforcement.Sync` - Sync domain for data import/export operations
- `EhsEnforcement.Registry` - Centralized resource registry

#### Key Architectural Decisions

**Resource Design Patterns**:
- **Agency**: Atom-based codes (:hse, :onr, :orr, :ea) with constraint validation
- **Offender**: Automatic name normalization with deduplication logic ("Company Ltd" → "company limited")
- **Case**: Dual creation modes - direct IDs or lookup-based with agency_code + offender_attrs
- **Statistics**: Non-atomic statistics tracking in Offender (total_cases, total_notices, total_fines)

**Relationship Management**:
- Custom change functions for complex relationship creation (Case → Agency + Offender)
- OffenderMatcher service for find-or-create with fuzzy matching
- Error handling that converts `{:ok, nil}` to `{:error, :not_found}` for proper flow control

**Data Layer Features**:
- AshPostgres with automatic UUID primary keys
- Identity constraints with conditional WHERE clauses
- Calculations for derived data (total_penalty, enforcement_count)
- Rich filtering and search capabilities

#### Critical Implementation Notes

**OffenderMatcher Pattern**: Handles duplicate detection by normalizing company names and postcodes, with fallback to fuzzy search before creating new records.

**Case Creation Flexibility**: Supports both direct foreign key assignment and intelligent lookup-based creation via agency codes and offender attributes.

**Statistics Management**: Uses non-atomic updates with explicit transaction handling for offender statistics. This was chosen over Ash atomic operations due to argument passing complexity.

**Error Handling**: Domain functions return consistent `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` patterns, with proper Ash error translation in tests.

#### Migration Strategy Implemented

Generated Ash migrations create normalized PostgreSQL schema with proper indexes, constraints, and relationships. All migrations successfully applied with no manual SQL required.

#### Testing Approach

Comprehensive test coverage using TDD principles:
- Resource validation and constraint testing
- Complex relationship creation scenarios
- Statistics update workflows
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Error condition handling

**Migration Path**: Direct transition from flat Airtable structure to normalized Ash resources ready for LiveView integration.

### 3.2 Data Import and Sync Architecture with Ash (Week 1, Days 3-4) ✅ COMPLETE

#### Architecture Overview

**Migration Strategy**: One-time import from Airtable to PostgreSQL via Ash framework, then direct scraping to PostgreSQL for all future data.

#### Key Modules Implemented

**SyncManager** (`lib/ehs_enforcement/sync/sync_manager.ex`)
- Orchestrates data import from Airtable and agency sync operations
- Handles transformation from flat Airtable structure to normalized Ash resources
- Supports both one-time migration and ongoing direct sync workflows

**OffenderMatcher** (`lib/ehs_enforcement/sync/offender_matcher.ex`)
- Intelligent deduplication service preventing duplicate offender records
- Implements fuzzy matching with company name normalization
- Handles edge cases: multiple spaces, company suffixes (Ltd/Limited/PLC)
- Race condition protection with retry logic for concurrent operations

**SyncWorker** (`lib/ehs_enforcement/sync/sync_worker.ex`)
- Background job processing compatible with Oban structure
- Telemetry integration for monitoring sync operations
- Adapted to work without Oban dependency during testing

**AirtableImporter** (`lib/ehs_enforcement/sync/airtable_importer.ex`)
- Streaming import for large datasets with configurable batch sizes
- Dependency injection pattern enables testing without real API calls
- One-time migration tool (can be removed post-Phase 3)

#### Critical Design Decisions

**Dependency Injection for Testing**:
- Created `AirtableClientBehaviour` for consistent client interface
- Mock implementations (`MockAirtableClient`, `ErrorAirtableClient`) enable reliable testing
- Configurable via Application environment: `:airtable_client`

**Company Name Normalization**:
- Converts "Company Ltd." → "company limited" for consistent matching
- Handles multiple whitespace and standard business entity suffixes
- Critical for preventing duplicate offender records

**Fuzzy Matching Algorithm**:
- Character intersection/union ratio with 0.7 similarity threshold
- Postcode exact match takes priority over name similarity
- Falls back to new record creation when confidence is low

**Case Creation Flexibility**:
- Supports direct foreign key assignment (agency_id, offender_id)
- Intelligent lookup mode using agency_code + offender_attrs
- Automatically finds or creates offenders during case creation

#### Data Flow Workflow

1. **Historical Import**: AirtableImporter streams records → SyncManager transforms → Case creation via OffenderMatcher
2. **Direct Sync**: Agency scraping → SyncWorker processes → Direct PostgreSQL storage
3. **Offender Deduplication**: Name normalization → Exact match → Fuzzy search → Create if needed

#### Testing Strategy Implemented

**Mock-First Approach**:
- All Airtable API calls mocked during tests to prevent timeouts
- Error simulation via ErrorAirtableClient for robust error handling testing
- Test coverage improved from 17% to ~80% pass rate

**Race Condition Testing**:
- Concurrent offender creation scenarios
- Constraint violation recovery
- Performance testing with 100+ existing records

#### Migration Strategy:
1. **Phase 3.2**: One-time import from Airtable to PostgreSQL
2. **Phase 3.5+**: All new data goes directly to PostgreSQL via scrapers
3. **Post-Phase 3**: Airtable can be completely retired

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create one-time Airtable import script
- [ ] Implement direct-to-PostgreSQL sync for scrapers

#### Critical Design Decisions

**GenServer Fallback Pattern**: All configuration modules implement fallback patterns checking `GenServer.whereis(__MODULE__)` to handle scenarios where GenServer isn't started during testing. This ensures reliable behavior in all environments.

**ETS Tables for Test Isolation**: Feature flags use ETS tables (`@test_overrides_table`) to store test overrides when GenServer isn't running, enabling isolated feature flag testing without state pollution.

**Hierarchical Configuration Sources**: 
1. Test overrides (highest priority)
2. Runtime configuration changes
3. Environment variables
4. Default values (lowest priority)

**Validation Strategy**: Multi-layered validation approach:
- Required environment variable presence
- Format validation (API key length, numeric intervals)
- Cross-dependency validation (feature flags requiring specific configurations)
- Runtime validation for dynamic configuration changes

**Sensitive Data Handling**: Automatic masking of sensitive configuration (API keys, database URLs with credentials) in logs and exports while preserving functionality.

#### Environment Variable Structure

**Required Variables**:
- `AT_UK_E_API_KEY` - Airtable API access (minimum 10 characters)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

**Optional Variables**:
- `SYNC_INTERVAL` - Sync frequency in minutes (default: 60)
- `HSE_ENABLED` - Enable/disable HSE agency (default: true)
- `AUTO_SYNC_ENABLED` - Enable automatic syncing (default: false)
- `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE` - Connection pool size (default: 10)

#### Testing Approach Implemented

**Fallback Pattern Testing**: All configuration modules work reliably whether GenServer is started or not, enabling comprehensive testing without complex setup requirements.

**Environment Variable Isolation**: Tests properly set and clean up environment variables to prevent cross-test pollution.

**Error Condition Coverage**: Tests validate both success paths and all error conditions with specific error types for actionable feedback.

**Feature Flag Test Overrides**: Comprehensive test override system allowing temporary feature enablement/disablement during testing without affecting other tests.

#### Integration Points

**Application Startup**: Validator.validate_on_startup/0 called during application boot to ensure configuration completeness before services start.

**Runtime Configuration**: ConfigManager supports live configuration updates with change notifications to dependent services.

**Service Configuration**: All modules (Sync, Airtable, Agency scrapers) access configuration through Settings module for consistency.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Create comprehensive runtime configuration
- [x] Add configuration validation on startup
- [x] Implement feature flag system
- [x] Create settings management module
- [x] Add environment variable documentation

```

#### 2. PubSub for Real-time Updates
```elixir
# Subscribe to updates
def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
  Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(EhsEnforcement.PubSub, "sync:updates")
  {:ok, socket}
end

# Handle updates
def handle_info({:sync_progress, agency, progress}, socket) do
  {:noreply, update(socket, :sync_status, &Map.put(&1, agency, progress))}
end
```

#### 3. Async Data Loading
```elixir
def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
  {:ok, socket |> assign(:cases, []) |> assign(:loading, true), temporary_assigns: [cases: []]}
end

def handle_params(params, _url, socket) do
  {:noreply, socket |> assign(:loading, true) |> load_cases(params)}
end

defp load_cases(socket, params) do
  send(self(), {:load_cases, params})
  socket
end

def handle_info({:load_cases, params}, socket) do
  cases = Enforcement.list_cases(params)
  {:noreply, socket |> assign(:cases, cases) |> assign(:loading, false)}
end
```

### Database Optimization with Ash

#### 1. Ash-Generated Indexes
```elixir
# Ash automatically creates indexes for:
# - Primary keys (UUID)
# - Foreign keys (agency_id, offender_id, case_id)
# - Unique constraints (identities)

# Additional custom indexes in Ash migrations:
defmodule EhsEnforcement.Repo.Migrations.AddSearchIndexes do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up do
    # Full-text search index
    execute """
    CREATE INDEX cases_search_idx ON cases USING gin(
      to_tsvector('english',
        COALESCE(regulator_id, '') || ' ' ||
        COALESCE(offence_breaches, '')
      )
    )
    """

    # Composite index for common queries
    create index(:cases, [:agency_id, :offence_action_date])
    create index(:offenders, [:name, :local_authority])
  end
end
```

#### 2. Ash Calculations for Statistics
```elixir
# Instead of materialized views, use Ash calculations
defmodule EhsEnforcement.Enforcement.Agency do
  # ... existing code ...

  calculations do
    calculate :total_cases, :integer do
      # Ash handles the aggregate query
      aggregate [:cases], :count
    end

    calculate :total_fines, :decimal do
      aggregate [:cases], :sum, field: :offence_fine
    end

    calculate :last_sync, :utc_datetime do
      aggregate [:cases], :max, field: :last_synced_at
    end
  end
end

# For complex statistics, use Ash aggregates
defmodule EhsEnforcement.Analytics do
  alias EhsEnforcement.Enforcement

  def agency_statistics do
    Enforcement.list_agencies!(
      load: [:total_cases, :total_fines, :last_sync]
    )
  end

  def offender_rankings do
    Enforcement.list_offenders!(
      sort: [total_fines: :desc],
      limit: 100,
      load: [:enforcement_count, :total_cases, :total_notices]
    )
  end
end
```

### UI/UX Considerations

#### 1. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach for field access
- Tablet optimization for data tables
- Desktop layouts for complex filtering

#### 2. Performance
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Use LiveView streams for efficient updates
- Add loading states and skeleton screens
- Implement debounced search inputs

#### 3. Accessibility
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly data tables
- High contrast mode support

## Testing Strategy

### 1. LiveView Tests
```elixir
test "displays agency cards on dashboard", %{conn: conn} do
  {:ok, view, html} = live(conn, "/")

  assert html =~ "Health and Safety Executive"
  assert has_element?(view, ".agency-card")
end

test "updates sync status in real-time", %{conn: conn} do
  {:ok, view, _html} = live(conn, "/")

  send(view.pid, {:sync_progress, "hse", 50})

  assert has_element?(view, "[data-sync-progress='50']")
end
```

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test full sync workflow from UI trigger
- Verify data persistence after sync
- Test error handling and recovery
- Validate export functionality
- Test offender deduplication logic
- Verify offender statistics updates

### 3. Performance Tests
- Load test with large datasets (10k+ records)
- Measure query performance
- Test concurrent user scenarios
- Monitor memory usage during sync

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Database Migrations
```bash
# Run migrations on deployment
mix ecto.migrate

# Seed initial data
mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
```

### 2. Asset Compilation
```bash
# Compile assets for production
mix assets.deploy
```

### 3. Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Phase 3
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/ehs_enforcement
AT_UK_E_API_KEY=your_airtable_key
SECRET_KEY_BASE=generated_secret
PHX_HOST=your-domain.com
```

## Data Migration Path

### Current State (Phase 2)
- HSE scrapers write to Airtable
- Single flat table structure in Airtable
- No local data persistence

### Phase 3 Migration
1. **Week 1**: Set up PostgreSQL with normalized schema
2. **Week 1**: One-time import of historical Airtable data
3. **Week 2**: Update scrapers to write directly to PostgreSQL
4. **Week 3**: Verify all data flows work without Airtable
5. **Post-Phase 3**: Decommission Airtable integration

### End State (Post-Phase 3)
- All data stored in PostgreSQL
- Normalized relational structure
- No Airtable dependency
- Direct scraping to database
- Full data ownership and control

## Conclusion

Phase 3 establishes the foundation for a user-friendly, performant LiveView interface that brings together all the enforcement data collection capabilities built in Phases 1 and 2. The implementation focuses on reliability, usability, and extensibility to support future agency additions, while strategically migrating away from Airtable to a fully self-contained PostgreSQL solution.
