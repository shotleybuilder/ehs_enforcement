# Airtable Client Refactor Plan - HTTPoison to Req Migration

**Phase**: 2.1 Service Integration Sub-task  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Timeline**: 2-3 days (Completed in 1 day)  
**Priority**: High  

## Overview

Refactor the Airtable client modules to use modern `Req` library instead of deprecated `HTTPoison`, while improving standalone functionality, error handling, and maintainability.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Current Modules (HTTPoison-based):
```
lib/ehs_enforcement/integrations/airtable/
├── client.ex                    # HTTPoison.Base wrapper - NEEDS MAJOR REFACTOR
├── get.ex                      # GET operations using client.ex
├── post.ex                     # POST operations using Req (already migrated)
├── patch.ex                    # PATCH operations using Req (already migrated) 
├── at_post.ex                  # Legacy POST - REMOVE
├── at_patch.ex                 # Legacy PATCH using HTTPoison - REFACTOR
├── records.ex                  # Complex pagination logic using HTTPoison - REFACTOR
├── endpoint.ex                 # ✅ Simple endpoint URL provider
├── headers.ex                  # ✅ Headers with auth token
├── url.ex                      # ✅ URL building utilities
├── at_tables.ex               # ✅ Table ID management
├── at_bases.ex                # ✅ Base ID management  
├── at_bases_legl.ex           # ✅ Legacy base mapping
├── at_bases_tables.ex         # ✅ Combined base/table operations
├── uk_airtable.ex             # High-level API using records.ex - UPDATE
├── airtable_params.ex         # ✅ Parameter validation
├── at_fields.ex               # ✅ Field utilities
├── at_formulas.ex             # ✅ Formula building
└── at_views.ex                # ✅ View utilities
```

### Issues with Current Implementation:
1. **Mixed Libraries**: Some modules use HTTPoison, others use Req
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error formats across modules
3. **Complex Client.ex**: HTTPoison.Base wrapper adds unnecessary complexity
4. **Legacy Code**: Multiple modules doing similar things (post.ex vs at_post.ex)
5. **Hard Dependencies**: Direct HTTPoison references throughout codebase

## Migration Strategy

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### New Req Client Architecture

```elixir
# lib/ehs_enforcement/integrations/airtable/req_client.ex
defmodule EhsEnforcement.Integrations.Airtable.ReqClient do
  @moduledoc """
  Modern Req-based Airtable API client with rate limiting and error handling
  """
  
  require Logger
  
  @base_url "https://api.airtable.com/v0"
  @rate_limit_per_second 5
  @timeout 30_000
  @retry_attempts 3
  
  # Standard interface methods
  def get(path, params \\ %{}, opts \\ [])
  def post(path, data, opts \\ [])  
  def patch(path, data, opts \\ [])
  def delete(path, opts \\ [])
  
  # Internal implementation
  defp make_request(method, path, data, opts)
  defp handle_response({:ok, response})
  defp handle_response({:error, error})
  defp should_retry?(error, attempt)
  defp rate_limit_delay()
end
```

### Response Standardization

```elixir
# Standardized response format
{:ok, %{
  records: [...],
  offset: "...",
  metadata: %{...}
}}

# Standardized error format  
{:error, %{
  type: :rate_limit | :not_found | :validation | :network | :timeout,
  code: "...",
  message: "...",
  details: %{...}
}}
```

### Configuration Structure

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :ehs_enforcement, :airtable,
  api_key: {:system, "AIRTABLE_API_KEY"},
  base_url: "https://api.airtable.com/v0",
  timeout: 30_000,
  rate_limit: 5,
  retry_attempts: 3,
  retry_backoff: :exponential
```

### Migration Checklist

#### Pre-Migration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Audit all current HTTPoison usage
- [x] Identify all modules that need updates
- [x] Create comprehensive test coverage for existing functionality
- [x] Document current API behavior and edge cases

#### Migration Steps ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement new ReqClient with feature parity
- [x] Update one module at a time, testing each change
- [x] Run integration tests after each module update
- [x] Monitor for any breaking changes or regressions

#### Post-Migration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Remove all HTTPoison dependencies from mix.exs
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new client usage
- [x] Add monitoring and alerting for API health
- [x] Performance testing and optimization

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Breaking Changes**: API behavior changes could break existing functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout
  
- **Rate Limiting**: New client might trigger rate limits
  - *Mitigation*: Conservative rate limiting with monitoring

### Medium Risk  
- **Performance Impact**: New client might be slower/faster
  - *Mitigation*: Performance benchmarking and optimization

- **Configuration Issues**: Environment-specific problems
  - *Mitigation*: Staging environment testing

### Low Risk
- **Dependency Issues**: Req library compatibility
  - *Mitigation*: Req is well-maintained and stable

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] All existing Airtable operations continue to work
- [x] No data loss or corruption during migration
- [x] Error handling is improved, not degraded
- [x] API rate limits are respected

### Non-Functional Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Response times within 10% of current performance
- [x] Memory usage does not increase significantly
- [x] Code is more maintainable and readable
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

### Quality Gates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] All tests pass (unit + integration)
